  <description>
    <p>
      Tux Paint is a free, award-winning drawing program for children ages 3 to
      12.
      Tux Paint is used in schools around the world as a computer literacy
      drawing activity.
      It combines an easy-to-use interface, fun sound effects, and an
      encouraging cartoon mascot who guides children as they use the program.

      Kids are presented with a blank canvas and a variety of drawing tools to
      help them be creative.
